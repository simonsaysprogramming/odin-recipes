            <p>Mechado is one of those <a href="https://www.thekitchn.com/filipino-recipes-23650147"><strong>Filipino dishes</strong></a> that always tastes like home to me. It’s a slow-cooked beef stew with potatoes and carrots simmered in a tomato-based sauce. My mom used to make this for us when I was growing up, and it’s still one of my favorite meals. Whenever the pot was simmering on the stove, I knew dinner was going to be something comforting and delicious.</p>
            <p>A lot of <a href="https://www.thekitchn.com/filipino-beef-short-ribs-adobo-recipe-23688320"><strong>Filipino stews</strong></a> share similarities, but each has its own character. Afritada uses chicken and usually has a lighter tomato base, while kaldereta is known for its richer flavor and sometimes includes liver spread. Menudo is usually made with pork, along with smaller diced vegetables. Mechado sits somewhere in between — still tomato-forward, but with tender <a href="https://www.thekitchn.com/whats-the-difference-between-top-round-roast-and-chuck-roast-242523"><strong>beef chuck</strong></a> that makes it especially satisfying. It’s cozy, hearty, and one of the most comforting meals you can make.</p>

            <li><strong>Vegetables:</strong> Use a combination of Yukon Gold potatoes, carrots, and red bell pepper for the stew.</li>

            <li><strong>Soy sauce:</strong> Adds umami and savory flavor.</li>

        <h2>How to Make Mechado</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Sear the beef chuck.</strong> Heat a bit of oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add the beef chuck roast pieces in batches and sear until browned on all sides. Transfer to a plate.</li>
            <li><strong>Add aromatics and sauces.</strong> Stir in the onion and garlic, cooking until softened and fragrant. Stir in the water, tomato sauce, soy sauce, brown sugar, bay leaves, black pepper, and seared beef.</li>
            <li><strong>Cover and cook.</strong> Reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and let it simmer. You can also transfer the covered pot to the oven and let it braise.</li>
            <li><strong>Add the vegetables.</strong> Once the beef is nearly tender, add the potatoes, carrots, and red bell pepper. Continue cooking until the veggies are soft and the beef is very tender.</li>
            <li><strong>Serve with rice.</strong> Serve with steamed white rice and drizzle heavily with the sauce.</li>
