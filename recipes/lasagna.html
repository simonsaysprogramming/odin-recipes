        <p>One thing you should know about me is that I’ve cooked through a lot of lasagna recipes over the years, particularly in the past four years. During 2020, when everyone was baking <a href="https://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-make-sourdough-bread-224367"><strong>sourdough</strong></a> and <a href="https://www.thekitchn.com/banana-bread-recipes-23004781"><strong>banana bread</strong></a>, I was deep in a rabbit hole of making the best possible lasagna for my family. I cooked <a href="https://www.thekitchn.com/lasagna-recipe-simple-22956038"><strong>simple lasagnas</strong></a>,<a href="https://www.thekitchn.com/lasagne-alla-bolognese-recipe-23087496"><strong>classic lasagna bolognese</strong></a>,<a href="https://www.thekitchn.com/white-lasagna-recipe-23213953"><strong>white lasagna</strong></a>, and even <a href="https://www.thekitchn.com/cottage-cheese-lasagna-trick-23681492"><strong>lasagna with cottage cheese</strong></a>.</p>
        <p>When I recently embarked on developing a more traditional lasagna, I talked with a few lasagna experts. First up was my friend Maria, who grew up just outside Venice, Italy, and has strong, prideful feelings on cooking traditional Italian food. I knew she’d have a lot to say about lasagna, including advice from her mother, who is a private chef. The most important thing Maria had to say is that “ricotta is a hard no! Lasagna must be made with <a href="https://www.thekitchn.com/bechamel-sauce-recipe-23686140"><strong>béchamel sauce</strong></a> — and you should season it with a pinch of nutmeg.” When asked about meat sauce versus bolognese, Maria was adamant about <a href="https://www.thekitchn.com/bolognese-recipe-reviews-23123976"><strong>bolognese sauce</strong></a>. Even though it’s a lot of work, she says it makes a more flavorful lasagna. Lastly, she emphasized that a good lasagna starts with high-quality ingredients. This point sounds so simple, but having tested this recipe using a variety of brands, I whole-heartedly agree.</p>
        <p>I also spoke with Jeanette Donnarumma (a recipe developer and culinary producer formerly of the <em>Rachael Ray Show</em>), whose take on lasagna I was especially excited about. Jeanette explained that she’s an Italian American who grew up in a ricotta lasagna home, but now swears by lasagna made with a Parmesan-heavy béchamel. She went on to say that béchamel is the best option for a great lasagna because ricotta “just isn’t moist enough for a juicy lasagna and nobody likes a dry lasagna.” </p>
        <p>This is my spin on a traditional Italian lasagna (lasagna bolognese, if you will). It has all the components you’d expect, but I’ve taken a few liberties to minimize both prep and cook time. It’s creamy, saucy, and feels incredibly special without tasting overly rich or heavy, and it’s the farthest thing from being dry. Making lasagna is a labor of love since it takes a fair amount of time, but the good news is that nothing about this recipe is tricky or complicated, and it uses readily available, easy-to-find ingredients.</p>

        <h2>Why You’ll Love It</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>It uses béchamel instead of ricotta.</strong> Above all else, this creamy sauce makes the lasagna taste totally luxurious without feeling heavy. It also keeps the filling moist so it doesn’t dry out or get that crumbly texture that sometimes happens with ricotta.</li>
            <li><strong>Many of the components are make-ahead.</strong> There are a couple of opportunities to get a head start with this recipe. My favorite is making the bolognese and béchamel sauces a day in advance, and then the next day, assembling and baking the lasagna. You can also fully assemble the lasagna a day before baking.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Key Ingredients in Lasagna</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Diced pancetta:</strong> The rendered fat is used to cook the ground meat and vegetables, and it adds more flavor and the tiniest hint of richness to the bolognese.</li>
            <li><strong>Ground meat:</strong> Go for lean ground beef so there’s no need to drain off excess grease.</li>
            <li><strong>Crushed tomatoes:</strong> Many recipes use <a href="https://www.thekitchn.com/the-best-brand-of-whole-canned-tomatoes-you-can-buy-252450"><strong>canned whole peeled tomatoes</strong></a> that need to be crushed with your hands. This option is more convenient and less messy.</li>
            <li><strong>Tomato paste:</strong> A few tablespoons deepen the tomato flavor in the bolognese.</li>
            <li><strong>Milk:</strong> I love whole milk, which makes a slightly richer béchamel sauce, though 2% milk works well and does also make a good sauce.</li>
            <li><strong>Dried lasagna noodles:</strong> Maria emphasized the importance of using high-quality pasta, and after testing this recipe with several different brands, I 100% agree. I can’t stress this enough: Good-quality dried pasta makes all the difference here (my favorite brands are <a href="https://www.instacart.com/products/73703-de-cecco-lasagne-no-1-16-oz"><strong>De Cecco</strong></a> and <a href="https://www.instacart.com/products/28121755-rummo-lasagne-no-83-1-lb"><strong>Rummo</strong></a>).</li>
            <li><strong>Parmesan cheese:</strong> You can grate your own or use grated store-bought Parm — both work well.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>How to Make Lasagna</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Make the bolognese.</strong> Cook the bolognese and let it simmer until slightly thickened and the flavors meld. Meanwhile, soak the noodles and make the béchamel.</li>
            <li><strong>Soak the noodles.</strong> Arrange dried lasagna noodles in a 9×13 <a href="https://www.thekitchn.com/best-casserole-dishes-23227146"><strong>baking dish</strong></a> and cover with very hot tap water. It’s helpful to move the noodles around occasionally and separate any stacked noodles so they don’t stick together. When ready, drain the noodles and dry the baking dish.</li>
            <li><strong>Make the béchamel.</strong> Simmer the béchamel just until thickened.</li>
            <li><strong>Assemble the lasagna.</strong> Spread a thin layer of bolognese in the bottom of the baking dish. Layer with lasagna noodles, bolognese sauce, béchamel sauce, and grated Parmesan. Repeat for a second layer, then top with the remaining noodles, bolognese, béchamel, and Parmesan.</li>
            <li><strong>Bake the lasagna and cool.</strong> Bake uncovered until the cheese is melty and the sauce is bubbly. Pop under the broiler for just a couple minutes if you want the cheese browned in spots (keep a close eye on it). Cool at least 15 minutes before slicing and serving.
