<p>One of the first things I ever learned to cook was Hamburger Helper, and I have fond memories of following the directions printed on the box. Cheeseburger casserole is the homemade version of the convenience meal of my youth, and it’s just as easy: Brown <a href="https://www.thekitchn.com/where-does-ground-beef-come-from-meat-basics-217840"><strong>ground beef</strong></a> with onions and then simmer it with macaroni, beef broth, and pantry seasonings for a hearty one-pot meal cooked entirely on the stovetop. The finishing touch is a good heaping of cheddar cheese, something no good cheeseburger should be without.</p>
<h2>The Ingredients You’ll Need for Cheeseburger Casserole</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Ground beef:</strong> Use lean ground beef here so that you don’t have a lot of excess grease that you have to drain off.</li>
    <li><strong>Onion:</strong> Diced onion cooks down and gives the casserole a signature burger-like flavor.</li>
    <li><strong>Macaroni:</strong> Dried macaroni is the classic noodle in this casserole because it cooks quickly.</li>
    <li><strong>Cheddar cheese:</strong> Sharp cheddar cheese is a good combination of bright flavor that melts nicely into the sauce.</li>
    <li><strong>Beef broth:</strong> You’ll need one carton of beef broth.</li>
    <li><strong>Diced tomatoes:</strong> Diced tomatoes add some liquid and acidity. You can use regular or petite-sized canned diced tomatoes, and don’t drain off any of the liquid.</li>
    <li><strong>Tomato paste:</strong> As tomato paste cooks down, it adds a nice depth of flavor. Use the thicker kind from a tube if you can, although canned tomato paste will also work.</li>
    <li>Worcestershire sauce:</strong> Nothing beats the savoriness that Worcestershire adds to ground beef.</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Granulated garlic:</strong> Dried garlic helps to channel the Hamburger Helper flavors.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What’s the Best Pasta for Cheeseburger Casserole?</h2>
<p>Macaroni is the traditional choice for cheeseburger casserole, but any small, short pasta like small shells or rotelle will work. Keep in mind that different pastas might need a longer cook time or perhaps a splash more broth to cook through.</p>
<h2>How to Make Cheeseburger Casserole</h2>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Brown the onion and ground beef.</strong> Start by sautéeing diced onion and lean ground beef until the beef is cooked and the onion is tender.</li>
    <li><strong>Add the Worcestershire sauce and tomato paste.</strong> Cook with the Worcestershire sauce and tomato paste until slightly reduced and darkened in color.</li>
    <li><strong>Add the broth and tomatoes.</strong> Add a carton of beef broth and a can of diced tomatoes, and bring to a boil.</li>
    <li><strong>Cook the pasta.</strong> Add dried macaroni and cook until tender.</li>
    <li><strong>Finish with cheese.</strong> Stir in some of the cheddar cheese until melted, then top with more cheese. To melt the cheese on top, you can put a lid on and let it rest for a few minutes, or transfer the whole pot to the broiler instead for a more browned top.</li>
